# Odin recipes

A simple website demonstrating my html and css skills while going through
[the Odin project recipe website](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)
and beyond.

By the end of this mini project I will have a website that:

- Has a list of meals in its index page.
- Each meal has a dedicated page showing its ingredients and the steps needed to make the dish.

You can visit the website [here](https://mohammad-amin-khajeh.github.io/odin-recipes/).
